    description: 'We labeled single neurons with biocytin to stain their axonal and dendritic morphologies to enable their 3D reconstruction and their objective classification into morphological types (m-types). In addition, we also characterized the electrical firing patterns of these neurons to different intensities of step currents injected in the soma to group their response into electrical types (e-types). We then mapped the e-types expressed in each m-type to account for the observed diversity of morpho-electrical subtypes (me-types).',
