    description: 'A neuronal microcircuit is the smallest functional ecosystem in any brain region that encompasses a diverse morphological and electrical assortment of neurons, and their synaptic interactions. Blue Brain has pioneered data-driven digital reconstructions and simulations of microcircuits to investigate how local neuronal structure gives rise to global network dynamics. These methods could be extended to digitally reconstruct microcircuits in any brain region. Here we focus on the SSCx.',
