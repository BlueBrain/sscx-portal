          Welcome to BBP SomatoSensoryCortex (“<strong>SSCx</strong>”) portal (the “<strong>Portal</strong>”). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Here BBP provides you SSCx data (collectively and as further described, the "<strong>Data</strong>"),
          which includes quantitative information or qualitative statements collected, owned by or
          licensed to BBP in the course of its scientific work by experimentation, observation, modelling,
          interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence<strong>*</strong>. Data may be raw or primary
          (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or
          interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing
          sources where the rights may be held by others. Data files are in the process of continuous change and/or
          development. Files containing this Data are accessed, amended and/or updated as new data is gathered and/or
          processed. Some datasets may never be ‘finished’.

          prior notice, and your continued use of any of the Sites following any changes is an
          agreement by you to the change in Terms. We may change, suspend, discontinue, or remove
          any part of the Portal at any time, without prior notice, including the availability of

          <h3>Instructions for data use</h3>
          * Models of individual neurons (in the NEURON simulation environment) can be obtained
          from the me-type fact sheets. A model package contains a morphology file, the ion
          channel descriptions, the synapse descriptions and templates to instantiate the cell.
          There is code to construct the model, distribute the ion channels and synapses on the
          morphology, generate a GUI, and inject current clamp and synaptic input into the model.
          The morphology description is a formatted as a Neurolucide ASCII file. The ion
          channel and synapse description are available as NEURON MOD files.
          The code for the templates, GUI and simulations is written in the NEURON HOC language
          or Python. The files containing the synaptic parameters and m-type mappings are
          tab-separated files.
